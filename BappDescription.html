<p>The Log Requests to SQLite is a BURP extension developed with the aim of providing an audit trail of all HTTP requests sent through BURP. This objective comes from the common need during assessments of web applications spread over several days or weeks where tracking and recording every request becomes vital for future queries or audits by the client.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Once the extension is loaded, it prompts the user to select the database file (location and name) for the SQLite database where HTTP requests will be logged. This can be the same file as in a previous session.</p>

<p>The extension then logs every HTTP request made during the BURP session. Heres what it has to offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restrict logging to requests that are included in the defined target scope. Its in the BURP tab <code class=InlineCode>Target -&gt; Scope</code>.</li>
<li>Exclude logging for requests targeting images. The list of supported file extensions is available in the extension resources. Check is not case-sensitive.</li>
<li>An option to log the response content, in raw form, associated with a request. By default, this option is disabled.</li>
<li>Pause and continue logging at your convenience. After restarting Burp, the extension remembers the logging state from the previous session.</li>
<li>Change the DB file during a Burp session, given that the logging was paused.</li>
<li>Obtain statistics about the logged information in the database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>After loading the extension, youre prompted to choose where to store the SQLite database. Its advisable to use a file with the .db extension to facilitate usage with a SQLite client for exploration operations. This step is crucial because once the location and file name are set, the extension begins silent logging of every HTTP request sent during the BURP session.</p>

<p>You can use the available features to control and organize the logging process. For example, you may restrict the scope of logging, exclude image requests, log the raw response content, pause or resuming logging, change the DB file during a working session, or access statistics about the logged information.</p>

<p>The extension gives you control over the logging process but its your responsibility to understand your needs and use the features accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
The SQLite database can be explored using a SQLite client available at <a href=https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser>https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser</a></p>
